# GitHub silently ignores attempts to reassign that reserved env var, and it
# is unique per step anyway, so a later step could never read an earlier
# step's copy back through it. The run action itself stops its own
# throwaway proxy container before this script runs, so there is no
# long-lived container left to `docker compose exec` into either.
