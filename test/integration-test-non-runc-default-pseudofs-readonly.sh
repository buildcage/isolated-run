# Verifies that a real pseudo-filesystem mount NOT among runc's own default
# base-spec mounts (see freshMountDestinationsFrom in sandbox/oci-config.ts) is
# still forced read-only inside the sandbox, rather than being silently
# tolerated just because it superficially looks like a "kernel pseudo-fs".
# securityfs is a concrete, realistic example: it's commonly mounted at
# /sys/kernel/security on AppArmor-enabled hosts (the default on GitHub
# Actions' Ubuntu runner images), but runc's default spec never declares a
# mount for it. This test synthesizes an equivalent mount at a throwaway
# location outside every writable exception, since remounting the real
# /sys/kernel/security wouldn't be safe to do from a test script.
