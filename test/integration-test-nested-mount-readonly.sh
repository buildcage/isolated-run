# Verifies that a real filesystem separately mounted underneath a writable
# exception (here, a bind mount under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE) is still visible
# but individually forced read-only inside the sandbox -- the writable
# guarantee covers only the exception paths themselves
# (workdir/home/tmp/RUNNER_TEMP/writable:), not everything nested under
# them (see computeReadonlyHostMounts: protectedPaths is checked by exact
# match, not by prefix). Ordinary files/directories under workdir (not
# separate mount points) are already covered by
# integration-test-defaults.sh; this covers the separate-mount case
# specifically, which computeReadonlyHostMounts handles differently -- a
# regression guard against a future change that widened the writable
# exception into a mount-point prefix match instead of an exact one.
