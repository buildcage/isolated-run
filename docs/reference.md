# Reference

This page holds every input and output of the action, the rule grammar in full, what the report and
the traffic artifact contain, and how a `write_through:` entry is resolved. The
[README](../README.md) covers what Buildcage does and how to adopt it, and links here for the
details.

## Action inputs

`run` is the only required input.

| Input                             | Default      | Description                                                                                                                   |

| `upload_traffic_artifact`         | `false`      | Upload the observed traffic as a JSON artifact, `inspect` only. See [Traffic artifact](#traffic-artifact).                    |
| `traffic_artifact_retention_days` | empty        | How long to keep that artifact, in days; empty uses the repository's own default                                              |

### Rule inputs

All of these are empty by default, and all of them are additive: a connection is allowed when any
rule in any input matches. Which ones apply depends on the engine.

| Input                 | `inspect` | `universal` | What one rule matches                                                                           |
| --------------------- | :-------: | :---------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `allowed_url_rules`   |    ✅     |      -      | A method and a URL: `GET https://registry.npmjs.org/**`                                         |
| `allowed_https_rules` |    ✅     |     ✅      | A host and port reached over HTTPS: `registry.npmjs.org:443`                                    |
| `allowed_http_rules`  |    ✅     |     ✅      | A host and port reached over plain HTTP: `deb.debian.org:80`                                    |
| `allowed_ip_rules`    |    ✅     |     ✅      | An address and port, for connections made without DNS: `192.168.1.1:443`                        |
| `allowed_tls_rules`   |    ✅     |      -      | A TLS destination to pass through undecrypted, judged on SNI: `db.example.com:5432`             |
| `known_blocked_rules` |    ✅     |     ✅      | A host, or (on `inspect`) a method and URL, expected to be blocked, so it doesn't fail the step |

Under `inspect`, `allowed_https_rules` and `allowed_http_rules` still work and are kept for
compatibility, but `allowed_url_rules` covers them: a host rule is the same as a URL rule with any
method and any path.

Setting a rule the engine can't act on is caught before the command starts: `restrict` fails, since
a rule that looks like it protects the step but cannot be enforced is worse than none, and `audit`
warns and ignores it.

## Outputs

| Output                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `traffic_artifact_name` | Name of the uploaded traffic artifact, when `upload_traffic_artifact` produced one. Empty otherwise, so a later step can tell an upload apart from none having been requested. |

## Operation modes

| `proxy_mode` | What it does                                                      | When to use it                                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `audit`      | Logs every destination the command reaches and blocks nothing     | First setup, adding a dependency, investigating a failure |
| `restrict`   | Allows only what the rules match, blocks and logs everything else | Everyday workflows, security-critical steps               |

`audit` allows what the active engine can classify. A connection it cannot classify, such as an HTTP
request carrying no `Host` header, is still refused, on each engine's own terms.

Because `audit` enforces nothing, the `allowed_*_rules` have no effect in it; you write them when
you move to `restrict`.

Under `inspect`, `audit` is not a passive observer: TLS is still terminated, so a tool that pins a
certificate fails there exactly as it would under `restrict`. `universal`'s audit mode decrypts
nothing and breaks nothing.

If you forget a domain the command needs, `restrict` blocks it and the step fails with the
destination named, which is why it is worth running `audit` first.

## Rule syntax

`allowed_url_rules` and `allowed_tls_rules` need `proxy_engine: inspect`. The host rules work with
either engine.

### URL rules: `allowed_url_rules`

A rule is a method list, a space, then a URL pattern. Because a rule contains a space, this input is
newline-separated. The method is required, so a rule always states what it permits. A `#` at the
start of a line, or after whitespace, begins a comment that runs to the end of the line, and a blank
line is ignored, which helps once the list gets long. A `#` with no space before it is not a
comment: since `#` never legitimately appears in a rule (it is part of no host or URL, and a
fragment never travels with a request), it is reported as a mistake rather than silently trimmed.

```yaml
allowed_url_rules: |
  # npm: fetch packages, and the audit endpoint it posts to
  GET https://registry.npmjs.org/**
  POST https://registry.npmjs.org/-/npm/v1/security/advisories/bulk

  # pip: one registry, two domains
  GET https://pypi.org/simple/**
  GET https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/**

  # apt
  GET http://deb.debian.org/**

  # an internal service, on a non-default port
  GET|HEAD https://api.internal.example.com:8443/v1/*

  # anything at all on one internal host
  * https://tools.internal.example.com
```

Methods are separated by `|` or `,`, and `*` means any method. The port may be left out when it is
the scheme's default, and a pattern with no path allows any path on that host. A `#` fragment is
refused: it never travels with a request, so a rule carrying one could only match nothing.

| Pattern | In a domain                                       | In a path                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `**`    | crosses dots                                      | crosses `/`                   |
| `*`     | one or more, not crossing a dot                   | one or more, not crossing `/` |
| `?`     | one character                                     | one character                 |
| `~`     | raw regex, split into a host half and a path half |                               |

In a URL rule a wildcard may sit among literal text, inside a domain label or a path segment. Host
rules don't allow that:

```yaml
allowed_url_rules: |
  GET https://abc*.amazonaws.com/**
  GET https://example.com/pkg-*/**
```

A path or method never narrows what a wildcard _host_ resolves. See
[Inspect Proxy Engine](./security.md#inspect-proxy-engine) for why, and for how to write a host
pattern that doesn't widen more than intended.

A rule may name an address rather than a name. Nothing is loosened by that: the rules still match
against the `Host` header and still decide, and an address reached this way stays inspected, so
method and path rules apply to it. Over HTTPS the origin's certificate has to be valid for the
address, which needs an IP SAN, so in practice an address is a plaintext or a passthrough
destination.

### Host rules: `allowed_https_rules`, `allowed_http_rules`, `allowed_ip_rules`, `known_blocked_rules`

`allowed_https_rules`, `allowed_http_rules` and `allowed_ip_rules` share one syntax; rules are
separated by whitespace, so one per line reads best. A host rule is equivalent to a URL rule with any
method and any path. `known_blocked_rules` extends this syntax and is newline-separated, since a line
there can also be a URL rule; see [Blocked rules](#blocked-rules-known_blocked_rules).

```yaml
allowed_https_rules: |
  registry.npmjs.org:443
  repo.maven.apache.org:443
  *.internal.example.com:443
  registry.internal.example.com:8443

allowed_http_rules: |
  deb.debian.org:80
```

#### Wildcards

| Pattern | Matches                                                     | Example                                                                  |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `*`     | One or more characters **excluding** dots (single label)    | `*.example.com` matches `sub.example.com` but not `deep.sub.example.com` |
| `**`    | One or more characters **including** dots (multiple labels) | `**.example.com` matches `sub.example.com` and `deep.sub.example.com`    |
| `?`     | A single character excluding dots                           | `exampl?.com` matches `example.com`, `examplx.com`                       |

A label that contains `*` has to be exactly `*` or `**`. `abc*.example.com` is rejected here; only
[`allowed_url_rules`](#url-rules-allowed_url_rules) takes a wildcard in the middle of a label.

#### Ports

A port is required on every rule.

| Rule                 | Matches                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `example.com:443`    | `example.com` on port 443 only                                |
| `*.example.com:8443` | Any single-level subdomain of `example.com` on port 8443 only |
| `example.com:*`      | `example.com` on any port                                     |

`known_blocked_rules` is the exception: a host rule there that names no port is read as `:*`. It is
matched against rows of the report rather than against connections, and a row for a name the
resolver refused has no port at all, nothing having been connected to. `telemetry.example.com` and
`telemetry.example.com:*` are the same rule.

### Blocked rules: `known_blocked_rules`

`known_blocked_rules` lists traffic that is expected to be blocked, so a run isn't failed over a
refusal you already know about. It does not allow anything: the traffic stays blocked. That is the
point for a telemetry endpoint you want refused but not treated as an error, where allowing it would
let the request through.

Unlike the allow inputs it is newline-separated, one rule per line, because a line can be either
form:

- a **host rule** (`host:port`, the syntax above), which works on either engine; and
- a **URL rule** (a method and a URL, the [`allowed_url_rules`](#url-rules-allowed_url_rules)
  syntax), which needs `proxy_engine: inspect`, the only engine that sees a method or a path.

```yaml
known_blocked_rules: |
  # host rules: acknowledge every port on a name, or a specific one
  telemetry.example.com
  *.metrics.example.com:443

  # URL rules (inspect only): acknowledge one endpoint on an otherwise-allowed host
  POST https://api.example.com/telemetry
  * https://noisy.example.com/health
```

A URL rule marks only requests that carry the method and path it names, so it acknowledges one
endpoint on a host while any other blocked request to the same host still fails the step. A
host-level refusal — a name the resolver refused, or a connection blocked before any request was
read — carries no method or path, so it is matched by a host rule, never a URL rule. Port handling
follows each form: a host rule with no port reads as `:*`, a URL rule with no port as the scheme's
default (`443`/`80`), exactly as in the allow inputs.

Because a URL rule matches nothing on an engine that never sees a method or a path, a URL line under
`proxy_engine: universal` is refused in `restrict` mode and warned about in `audit`, the same split
`allowed_url_rules` gets. A host line works on every engine.

> **Migrating from v1.** `known_blocked_rules` was whitespace-separated, so several host rules could
> share a line. It is now newline-separated: put each rule on its own line.

### IP addresses: `allowed_ip_rules`

Connections made straight to an address never go through DNS, so they are allowed separately from
any domain. IPv4 only, and what a rule may hold depends on the engine:

| Engine      | A rule can be                                               | It cannot be       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `inspect`   | An address, a CIDR block (`10.0.0.0/8:443`), or a `~` regex | A wildcard pattern |
| `universal` | An address, a wildcard, or a `~` regex                      | A CIDR block       |

```yaml
# inspect
allowed_ip_rules: |
  192.168.1.10:443
  10.0.0.0/8:443
  ~^172\.16\.\d+\.\d+:5432$

# universal
allowed_ip_rules: |
  192.168.1.10:443
  192.168.1.*:443
```

A rule is matched against the address the connection goes to, never a name the connection carries,
so a rule naming a host is refused at setup. A range that covers the proxy's own address, which
every name resolves to inside the cage, still leaves a connection made through a name to the domain
rules. Either way the connection is tunnelled without
inspection: once an `ip:port` pair is allowed, any TCP-based protocol can use that path. Prefer a
domain rule where the destination has a stable name.

### TLS passthrough: `allowed_tls_rules`

For TLS traffic that isn't HTTPS, and for HTTPS that must not be decrypted. The SNI and port are
checked and the connection passes through undecrypted, so the command validates the origin's own
certificate. The name is still resolved by the proxy, so a passthrough goes where the proxy resolved
it and not where the command aimed:

```yaml
allowed_tls_rules: |
  db.example.com:5432
  repo.maven.apache.org:443
```

A host rule input is split on whitespace, so a rule per line and a group of rules on one line both
work. Comments follow the same rule as [`allowed_url_rules`](#url-rules-allowed_url_rules): a `#` at
the start of a line, or after whitespace, runs to the end of the line, and a `#` with no space
before it is reported as a mistake rather than silently trimmed, since `#` is part of no host. The
second rule above is the shape to use for a JVM build whose keystore Buildcage cannot inject into (a
keystore under a non-default password, or a runner with no `keytool`); a JVM already on the runner
otherwise trusts the injected CA without a passthrough.

### Regular expressions

Prefix a rule with `~` to use a regular expression. A host rule's pattern is matched against
`domain:port` as one expression, so the port is part of the pattern and can be a regex itself. It
cannot be left out: either engine refuses a `~` host rule with no `:` in it, since what the pattern
is matched against always carries the port.

| Rule                              | Effect                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~^example\.com:443$`             | Matches `example.com` on port 443 only                     |
| `~^example\.com:\d+$`             | Matches `example.com` on any port                          |
| `~^.*\.example\.com:(443\|8443)$` | Matches any subdomain of `example.com` on port 443 or 8443 |
| `~^192\.168\.1\.\d+:80$`          | Matches a range of IP addresses (in `allowed_ip_rules`)    |

`^` and `$` are added where they are missing, so a pattern always covers the whole `domain:port`. An
IPv6 address is refused here as everywhere else in the rule syntax. A host name matches in any case,
as it does in a wildcard rule. The host part may not contain `'`, a backtick, `{$` or `{%`: no host
name does, and the resolver's configuration has no way to quote them.

In `allowed_url_rules` a `~` expression covers the URL, and is split at the first `/` after `://`:
everything before that `/` is matched against the host, everything from it onward against the path.

```yaml
allowed_url_rules: |
  # host half: example\.com   path half: /pub/.*$
  GET ~^https://example\.com/pub/.*$

  # the host half's port pattern can be any regex
  GET ~^https://example\.com:(443|8443)/.*$
  GET ~^https://example\.com:\d+/.*$
```

Leave the port out and the rule matches the scheme's default port only, 443 for `https` and 80 for
`http`; there is no implicit any-port, so write `example\.com:.*` to allow more.

A top-level `|` is not supported in either a host rule or a URL rule. The anchors would bind to one
branch each, and a URL rule's two halves are compiled separately, so a choice spanning them has no
meaning. Keep the `|` inside a group, or write one rule per alternative:

```yaml
# not supported
allowed_url_rules: |
  GET ~^https://a\.example\.com/x$|^https://b\.example\.com/y$

# supported
allowed_url_rules: |
  GET ~^https://(a|b)\.example\.com/x$
  GET ~^https://a\.example\.com/x$
  GET ~^https://b\.example\.com/y$
```

A group cannot straddle the `/` the rule is split at either. A rule the split cannot handle is
refused with an error naming what to write instead.

## Report details

Matching is per request, so a row that counts several requests to one host is Expected only when a
rule accounts for every one of them: a URL rule that names one endpoint leaves the host's other
blocked requests to fail the step. Once `known_blocked_rules` is set, the Blocked Hosts table gains
an **Expected** column (✅) on the matched rows. Under `inspect` those rows are also folded into one row per rule, named after the rule
and counting the hosts behind it (`*.example.com:* (12 hosts)`), below the rows nothing matched. A
rule covering noisy traffic then costs the table one line however many hosts it names, which matters
most when the noise puts its payload in the name itself and every request brings a new long
hostname. The individual hosts stay in **Communication details**, so `universal`, whose report has
no such section, folds nothing.

A name the step looked up and never connected to gets a row of its own, with `DNS` as the rule kind
and no port (folded like any other row when a `known_blocked_rules` rule matches it). Under
`inspect` that is the only trace of a name the step reached for and did not use, which is how a rule
wider than the step needs shows up. A name that was connected to has no such row: the request is
already there.

## Blocked service names

A row whose reason is `dns-service-not-allowed` is a service-discovery name,
`_mongodb._tcp.cluster0.x.mongodb.net` and the like. **Neither way of clearing it makes the record
resolve.** Buildcage's resolver serves no discovery record at all (see
[Service discovery](../README.md#service-discovery)), so the answer stays empty whatever you write;
what changes is only whether the row fails the step.

1. **Allow the host the name belongs to** (`cluster0.x.mongodb.net`). The lookup is then reported as
   `discovery` instead and leaves the table, and the step may connect to that host. This is the
   useful one whenever the step was trying to reach the service.
2. **List the service name in `known_blocked_rules`** (`_mongodb._tcp.cluster0.x.mongodb.net:*`).
   The row is marked Expected, folded under that rule, and stops failing the step. Nothing else
   changes, and the host stays unreachable.

Naming the service name in an `allowed_*` rule also clears the row, but it is the misleading option:
it reads as permission to reach something that nothing can connect to, and the record still does not
resolve.

## Requests that never arrived whole

Under `inspect`, a connection can end before a whole request has arrived. What the report does with
one turns on who ended it: a client that walks away decided nothing, while bytes Buildcage refused to
read as a request are a refusal like any other.

Whichever it was, the host is the name from the handshake's SNI; a TLS connection that carried none
was aimed at an address the step wrote out itself, so the address stands in. The plain-HTTP stage has
no SNI to fall back on and its destination is Buildcage's own address for every name-based
connection, so the host reads `(unknown)` there. The address it was sent to is still recorded, in the
`destination` field of the [traffic artifact](#traffic-artifact).

A row carries no method or URL where no request line ever parsed. `missing-host-header` is the
exception: that one did parse, so it keeps the method and the path it asked for, with `-` standing
where the `Host` would have been.

### The ones nobody decided

A connection the client ended before it sent a whole request reached no rule and no origin, so it is
in neither host table. **Communication details** shows it with ⚠️ and how it ended:

```
⚠️ 00:09.123: HTTPS untrusted-ca.example.com:443 -> client-aborted
⚠️ 00:11.407: HTTPS untrusted-ca.example.com:443 -> client-timeout
```

| Reason           | What happened                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `client-aborted` | the client finished the TLS handshake and then closed without sending a request |
| `client-timeout` | it held the connection open instead, until the timeout expired                  |

The commonest cause is a container with no `ca-certificates`: the client cannot verify the
certificate the `inspect` engine signs with, so every HTTPS request to that host ends at the
handshake before a request arrives. The step's own output says so first, as a certificate
verification error; installing `ca-certificates`, or otherwise letting the client trust the CA, is
what lets the requests through. An `allowed_https_rules` entry changes nothing, the host having
resolved and been dialled already.

A close like this is shown only where its host completed no other connection. Where the same host
also completed one, the close is a keepalive pool cleaning up after its work rather than a failure,
so it is left out of Communication details as noise. The raw [traffic artifact](#traffic-artifact)
keeps every one either way. Neither kind fails the step, not even with `fail_on_blocked: true`: no
rule refused it, so `known_blocked_rules` has nothing to match, and nothing reached an origin. A
`::warning::` annotation gives the count of those shown.

### The ones Buildcage refused

These are refusals: they are in **🚫 Blocked Hosts**, counted in the blocked-connections annotation,
and they fail the step under `fail_on_blocked: true` like any other refused connection.

```
🚫 00:14.002: GET https://-/pkg.tgz?token=*** -> missing-host-header
🚫 00:15.880: HTTP (unknown):5432 -> bad-request
```

| Reason                | What happened                                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bad-request`         | the step sent bytes that could not be read as an HTTP request at all   |
| `missing-host-header` | a request parsed, and carried no `Host` for a rule to match or resolve |

`bad-request` is most often a protocol that is not HTTP at all, a database or `git://` connection to
a port no `allowed_ip_rules` or `allowed_tls_rules` entry covers: anything that is not a TLS
handshake is handed to the plain-HTTP stage, which reads it as a request and refuses it. Both are
refused in `audit` mode too, as the same check is under `universal`, since a request naming no host
has nothing to connect to whatever the rules say.

What clears one is a rule, though not a host rule. For traffic that is not HTTP, add the port to
`allowed_ip_rules` or the name to `allowed_tls_rules`, and the connection is passed through
undecrypted instead of being read as a request. `known_blocked_rules` can mark a row whose host is a
name from the SNI; a row reading `(unknown)` names nothing a rule can be written against, so the
passthrough rule is the only way to clear that one.

## Connections that failed

A request no rule refused can still come to nothing: the origin answers nothing usable, breaks off
mid-transfer, or its name resolves nowhere. The report tables those apart from what the rules did
refuse, under **⚠️ Failed Connections**. Under `inspect`, **Communication details** shows each with
⚠️ too:

```
⚠️ 00:12.004: GET https://registry.npmjs.org/big.tgz -> origin-aborted
⚠️ 00:13.771: GET https://mirror.example.com/index -> origin-no-response
```

| Reason               | What happened                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `origin-no-response` | the connection was made, and no usable response headers came back     |
| `origin-aborted`     | the response started and the transfer was cut short                   |
| `dns-failed`         | the name resolved nowhere upstream, no rule having refused it         |
| `origin-unreachable` | a connection carrying no certificate of Buildcage's could not be made |

What the first two have in common is a connection that completed, which is where the origin's
certificate was checked: whatever went wrong afterwards went wrong with an origin Buildcage had
authenticated. `dns-failed` never reached a connection, and neither a plaintext request nor a
passthrough has a certificate of Buildcage's behind it: the first is carried as it was sent, the
second is relayed for the step to judge rather than decrypted.

`universal` writes its decision before the connection is made and never sees what became of it, so
`dns-failed` is the only one of the four it can report. `audit` reports them the same way, though
nothing there was allowed by a rule either: what the table says is that the rules are not what
stopped these.

**A connection Buildcage never completed is not here.** It is a refusal, it is in Blocked Hosts, and
it does fail the step:

| Reason                  | What happened                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `origin-untrusted`      | the origin's certificate was presented and Buildcage would not accept it |
| `origin-connect-failed` | the connection never completed, so no certificate was ever accepted      |

`origin-untrusted` is the plain case: a forged certificate, an expired one, or an origin speaking no
TLS at all. `origin-connect-failed` is the one that looks like an outage and cannot be shown to be
one. HAProxy retries a failed connection, and the TLS error it reports belongs to the last attempt
alone, so an impostor whose certificate is refused on one attempt leaves no trace once a later
attempt fails at TCP. The report does not claim to tell that from an origin that is simply down: a
connection it never completed is one whose origin it never authenticated. See
[Attempts to get around it](./security.md#attempts-to-get-around-it).

A host that is flaky rather than hostile is cleared the way any expected refusal is, by listing it
in `known_blocked_rules`.

None of the four fails the step, not even with `fail_on_blocked: true`, and a `::notice::` gives the
count. No rule refused them, so no rule can clear them either: `known_blocked_rules` has nothing to
match, and an `allowed_*` entry changes nothing. What clears one is the origin coming back, or the
build reaching for something that is up.

A blocked `DNS` row for the same name means something else entirely: that one is Buildcage's own
resolver saying no rule allows the name, and it does fail the step.

## Traffic artifact

`upload_traffic_artifact: true` uploads the report's timeline as a `traffic.json` inside an artifact
named `buildcage-traffic-<id>`, where `<id>` is this step's own container suffix so several steps in
one job never collide. It carries every name lookup, including the ones the summary folds into the
request that followed them, and service-discovery lookups with the record type that was asked for.
`universal` never sees a method or a URL, so this input only does anything under `inspect`.

This is also the form to keep where the report is an audit trail rather than something to read: in
`filesystem_mode: persistent` a later step can add to the Job Summary, but not to an artifact
already uploaded. See [Known Limitations](./security.md#known-limitations).

| `destination` |        | the address it actually resolved to; absent for `dns`                                    |

A field is absent because it does not apply, never because it was zero: a refusal has no status
because nothing answered, and a passthrough none because nothing was decrypted. Filter on `action`.
The artifact is uploaded even when the step fails, since a failing run is when it is most wanted.

Query strings are kept verbatim here, since that is also where an exfiltration payload would go. The
Job Summary is the exception: it replaces credential query parameters, see
[Credentials in a URL](./security.md#credentials-in-a-url).

## CA trust variables

`proxy_engine: inspect` terminates TLS and re-signs it with a CA generated for the step, so the
command has to trust that CA. The CA is valid for two days from when the proxy starts and carries a
random `serialNumber` in its subject, so no two runs share one. The CA, and where relevant an
augmented copy of the system CA store, is mounted over the sandbox's own view of those paths. The
store copy goes back over the path it was read from, which is what the tools going by their own
compiled-in path read, so it is whichever of the well-known store paths this runner actually has.
Nothing is written to the runner's filesystem, and the mount goes away with the sandbox when the
step ends.

The variables below are set only when the command's environment leaves them unset, and where each
one points depends on what it means to the tool that reads it:

| Variable              | Read by                                                                                                                                                      | If unset                                         |

A variable that is already set is left alone rather than appended to, and the CA is added to a store
that already exists rather than creating one. Both are in
[Limitations](../README.md#limitations), with what they mean for a command that needs TLS trust.

## `write_through` paths

`write_through:` names the paths whose writes reach the real host filesystem, in either
[filesystem mode](../README.md#filesystem-access). It is one path per line. Entries resolve like
this:

- A line whose first non-space character is `#` is a comment, and a blank line is skipped, so a
  group of paths can carry a heading. Unlike the rule inputs, only a whole-line `#` counts: a `#`
  anywhere else stays part of the path, since a path may legitimately contain one (or a space before
  one) and an inline comment could not be told apart from it.
- `$NAME` / `${NAME}` expand only for `HOME`, `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, `RUNNER_TEMP`, `GITHUB_OUTPUT`,
  `GITHUB_ENV`, `GITHUB_PATH`, and `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, not arbitrary env, so a value smuggled in
  through the step's own `env:` block can't redirect where a listed path resolves. Any other `$NAME`
  is rejected.
- A leading `~/` expands to `$HOME`.
- A relative path (`./dist`) resolves against `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, matching the sandbox's own
  working directory.
- A path that doesn't already exist is created before the step runs, **always as a directory**, the
  same convention Docker itself uses for a bind mount whose host source doesn't exist yet
  (`docker run -v`/`--mount`), never as a file. `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`, `$GITHUB_ENV`, `$GITHUB_PATH`, and
  `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` are the runner's own generated files and must already exist: a missing one
  is an error, not something this action creates. Anything else missing (`./dist`, say) is created
  for you as a directory, with the same owner and permissions as its nearest already-existing parent
  directory: a path under a tree the runner already owns becomes writable, same as today, but a path
  under a tree it doesn't own (`/etc/something`, for instance) is created yet stays exactly as
  unwritable to the sandboxed command as naming that existing parent directly would be. Nothing here
  grants access beyond what the surrounding filesystem already implies.
- A directory created that way is removed again when the step ends, but only if the command left it
  empty (`rmdir`, never `rm -r`), so a build output directory that actually received output stays.
  A step killed outright skips this and leaves the empty directory behind; the next run reuses it.
- `write_through:` accepts files as well as directories, but only a path that's **already** a file
  when the step starts; a missing target is always created as a directory (see above), never a file.
  A file entry is bind-mounted file-to-file (the same technique the `inspect` engine already uses to
  distribute its CA), so an append or a truncating write goes through, but a tool that replaces the
  file outright (`mv`, or unlink plus recreate) does not. `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` and
  `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`'s own contract is append-only, so this doesn't affect them in practice. If
  you need a file that doesn't exist yet to persist, either have an earlier step create it first, or
  list its (already-existing) parent directory instead.

Creating a missing path as that nearest existing parent's owner rather than as root means the
`mkdir` runs under `sudo -u '#uid' -g '#gid'`, and sudoers only lets you pick a group the target
user already belongs to. The `runner:docker` parent on a GitHub-hosted runner qualifies, since
`runner` is in `docker`; a parent carrying a group its own owner is not in (a setgid directory, say)
does not, and neither does a self-hosted runner whose sudoers names a single user to run commands
as. The step then fails with `write_through: <path> doesn't exist and couldn't be created`, carrying
`sudo`'s own refusal, before your command runs. It never falls back to creating the path as root.
Entries that already exist are never created and so never reach any of this.

`write_through:` changes how a path is mounted, not who owns it, so pointing it at a system
directory the runner user cannot write (`/usr`, most of `/etc`) gains nothing. It is meant for paths
outside `$HOME` that the workflow has already arranged for the runner user to write, in an earlier,
non-isolated step.

### Reserved paths

`/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/buildcage-ca.pem` are mounted by the sandbox itself to reach the
proxy's DNS and CA trust, and so is the runner's own CA store. Which path that last one is depends
on the runner, so every path a CA store is looked for at is reserved, whether or not this runner
keeps one there: `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`, `/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt`,
`/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem`, `/etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem` and `/etc/ssl/cert.pem`. An entry that worked on
one runner and failed on the next would be worse than one that is refused everywhere.

Naming a reserved path, or anything under one, fails the step rather than being quietly ignored.
Naming a directory that contains them (`write_through: /etc`) is fine: writes elsewhere under it
reach the host, and only the reserved paths themselves stay read-only. The same applies to the filesystems the sandbox mounts fresh, such as `/proc`
and `/dev`, and to the sandbox's own scratch directory under `/var/tmp`; see
[Known Limitations](./security.md#known-limitations).

### The `/` opt-out

`write_through: /` drops the read-only restriction wholesale, so it only means anything under
`persistent` and is rejected under `ephemeral`, where it would persist every write, the one thing
that mode exists to prevent. The sentinel is the literal `/` only: an entry that merely _resolves_
to `/` (a miscounted `../`, say) is an error rather than a silent full opt-out.

### The former input names

`write_through:` was called `writable:` before it covered both filesystem modes, and `allow_write:`
was its `filesystem_mode: ephemeral`-only counterpart. `writable:` still works and means the same
thing, with one change: its entries now go through the resolution above, so a relative entry
resolves against `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` rather than being passed through as-is, and a `$NAME` outside
the seven supported variables is rejected instead of being treated as a literal path. `allow_write:`
has been removed, and a step still passing it fails with a message saying so rather than silently
discarding the writes it asked to keep.
