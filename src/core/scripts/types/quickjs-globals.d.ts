/**
 * Ambient globals for the QuickJS runtime (quickjs-ng, Alpine 3.24's
 * `quickjs-ng` package) that these scripts run under via `qjs --std -m`.
 *
 * Verified directly against the actual `quickjs-ng` 0.11.0 Alpine package
 * (docker run alpine:3.24.1 + apk add quickjs-ng): the CLI's `--std` flag is
 * required to expose these modules at all, and — unlike Bellard's original
 * QuickJS — the import specifiers are namespaced as "qjs:std"/"qjs:os", not
 * bare "std"/"os" (bare specifiers fail with "could not load module
 * filename 'std'" even with --std passed).
 *
 * Covers only the APIs this codebase actually calls (verified by grep across
 * src/core/scripts, src/core/lib) — not a general QuickJS type definition.
 * This file must only ever be visible to
 * tsconfig.qjs.json's program (see its "types": []) — @types/node also
 * declares a module named "os", with an incompatible shape, and the two
 * would collide if this file were ever included alongside it.
