 * all. Everything else the phase already names, so the field stays `-`.
 *
 * Only the server's own causes name the origin. `P` is this proxy refusing,
 * whatever phase it happened in: `PH` is a response it judged invalid and `PC`
 * its own connection limit, neither of which the origin chose. In phase `R` it
 * is haproxy's own answer to bytes that parsed as no request at all, which the
 * method tells from a refusal the rules made.
 *
 * Phase `C` is a connection that never completed, and both of its reasons are
 * this proxy's own refusal. `tlserr` says which: the backend connects with
 * `ssl verify required` (see haproxy-sections.ts), and a handshake that failed
 * leaves haproxy's own error there, so `origin-untrusted` names a certificate
 * this proxy would not accept. Any error counts, whether it was forged or the
 * origin speaks no TLS at all: neither is an origin this proxy could
 * authenticate, and reading only the verify error would let the second pass as
 * an outage.
 *
 * `origin-connect-failed` is the rest of that phase, and is a refusal too
 * because it cannot be shown not to be one. `tlserr` belongs to the last
 * connection attempt alone and a failed handshake is retried, so a certificate
 * refused on one attempt leaves no trace once a later attempt fails at TCP:
 * measured on haproxy 3.4, an impostor logs `rc=3 ts=SC` with the verify error,
 * and the same impostor going silent partway through those retries logs
 * `ts=SC tlserr=-`, which is what an origin that is merely down logs too. The
 * report cannot tell them apart, so it does not claim to: a connection this
 * proxy never completed is one whose origin it never authenticated. A host that
 * is flaky rather than hostile is cleared the way any expected refusal is, with
 * known_blocked_rules.
 *
 * `tlsError` is undefined where this proxy checked no certificate at all, and
 * a connection it could not make there hid nothing: the plain stage carries
 * plaintext to `origin_plain`, which verifies nothing, and the passthrough
 * relays the handshake for the build to judge. Both stay `origin-unreachable`.
 * Only where a certificate was going to be checked is a connection that never
 * completed a refusal.
