/**
 * Reads an s6-log directory as one time-ordered stream: the rotated archive

 *
 * s6-log rotates `current` once it crosses its configured size, moving the
 * old content into a new `@<timestamp>.<letter>` file in the same
 * directory (see the haproxy-log/coredns-log `run` scripts). Reading only
 * `current` silently drops everything before the last rotation once a step
 * produces enough log traffic to cross that threshold — this is what report
 * generation did before this file existed.
 *
 * Mirrors buildcage/docker's `src/core/lib/docker/rotated-log.ts` (same
 * `Docker` shape, same fix for the same bug in a byte-identical `s6-log`
 * setup — see that repo's PR for the original writeup).
