/**
 * Domain pattern compiler for the `inspect` engine, which allows a wildcard
 * inside a label: `abc*.amazonaws.com`.
 *
 * The shared compiler in wildcard-rules.ts rejects that, requiring a label
 * containing `*` to be exactly `*` or `**`. For `universal` that is only
 * a restriction on how a rule can be phrased. For `inspect` it would be a
 * hazard, because the resolver's scope is generated from these same patterns:
 * a rule unable to say "only names beginning with abc" forces the author to
 * write `*.amazonaws.com` instead, widening what is allowed to resolve and
 * therefore what can leak through a DNS query alone.
 *
 * The wildcard vocabulary is otherwise unchanged, and keeps the same meaning
 * wherever it appears in a label:
 *
 *   `**`: one or more characters, dots included
 *   `*` : one or more characters, dots excluded
 *   `?` : a single character, dots excluded
 *
 * Kept separate from wildcard-rules.ts rather than added to it, so widening
 * this grammar cannot change what the `universal` engine accepts.
