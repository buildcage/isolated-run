/**
 * URL rule compiler for the `inspect` engine.
 *
 * A rule is a method list followed by a URL pattern:
 *
 *   GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@myorg/**
 *   GET|HEAD https://example.com/public/*
 *   * https://internal.example.com
 *
 * The method is required: there is no default, so a rule always states what it
 * permits.
 * Because a rule contains a space, the input is split on NEWLINES, unlike the
 * whitespace-separated host rules in wildcard-rules.ts.
 *
 * The URL pattern extends the host rule syntax to a path, applying the same
 * wildcard vocabulary to path segments instead of dot-separated labels. A
 * wildcard may sit among literal text, in a path segment as in a domain label;
 * see partial-wildcard.ts, which holds the vocabulary and why that matters.
 *
 * A `~` prefix on the URL passes the remainder through as a raw regex. Nothing
 * here is matched as one full-URL expression either way: haproxy matches the
 * authority and the path as two separate ACLs (see haproxy-rule-block.ts), and
 * the host half alone becomes the resolver's allowlist (see coredns-config.ts).
 *
 * Path traversal is not handled here: `*` cannot cross a `/`, but a segment
 * that is itself `..` still matches it, and `**` crosses freely, so haproxy
 * decodes and strips `..` from the path before any rule sees it; see
 * haproxy-inspect-stage.ts.
