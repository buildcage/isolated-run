/**
 * Full-text golden coverage of generateHaproxyConfig.
 *
 * haproxy-config.test.ts asserts on individual directives, which is what
 * catches a wrong one. These fix the whole file instead, so a change that
 * moves a section, reorders two ACLs or drops a line nothing asserts on still
 * shows up. Between them they reach every branch the options expose: both
 * modes, both resolver styles, each rule kind, and the host-address file.
 *
 * vitest-only (see test/golden.node.ts), so this file is kept out of the qjs test
 * bundle by rolldown.scripts.config.js's *.golden.test.ts exclude.
