/**
 * haproxy.cfg generator for the `inspect` engine.
 *
 * The config it emits relies on four HAProxy behaviours:
 *
 *  1. One listener takes both TLS and plaintext, told apart by the first bytes
 *     (`req.ssl_hello_type`), so no port is declared in advance and `audit`
 *     records everything unconfigured.
 *  2. The requested name is resolved here, only once the rules below already
 *     allowed the request, and connected to (`do-resolve` then `set-dst`), so
 *     a forged Host or doctored /etc/hosts cannot pick the destination, and a
 *     name a request would be denied for never triggers a real DNS query.
 *     This is the only place a name becomes a real address: the build's own
 *     resolver (CoreDNS) never gives one out; see coredns-config.ts.
 *  3. `..` in the path is resolved before the rules see it (`normalize-uri`).
 *  4. A leaf certificate is generated per SNI, so a refused destination is
 *     never contacted, and the origin certificate is verified on the backend
 *     connection, which is only reached once a request is allowed.
