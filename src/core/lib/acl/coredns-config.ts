 * Nothing is ever forwarded, so the query itself cannot leak what it asked
 * for.
 *
 * Real resolution happens once, in HAProxy, after a request has passed its
 * host, path and method check; see haproxy-config.ts. What this file decides
 * is only what gets logged as allowed or denied, and that has to match the
 * rules exactly, which is why the engine uses CoreDNS regex views over
 * dnsmasq suffix matching: the latter could only widen `abc*.amazonaws.com`
 * to `/amazonaws.com/`.
 *
 * Reverse lookups and service-discovery names are the exceptions; see
 * reverseZoneLines and discoveryZoneLines.
