/**
 * Neutralizes the structural Markdown in a piece of attacker-influenceable
 * text so it renders as its literal characters. Shared by the table cells and
 * the report heading (the `label` input); see render-report-markdown.ts, which
 * relies on this exact set so the heading stays as safe as the rows.
 *
 * A cell's text is attacker-chosen (a host comes from an SNI or a Host header),
 * and an unescaped `|` opens as many extra cells as it likes: a blocked host
 * can push its own "Reason" and "Expected" values into the row. Brackets and
 * angle brackets do the same to what the cell means, turning a host into a link
 * or raw HTML.
 *
 * `*` is escaped because a cell can carry a rule pattern, where `**.example.com:*`
 * would otherwise render as a lone `*` and an emphasized remainder, reading as a
 * different pattern than the one written. `_` is left alone: it emphasizes
 * nothing mid-word, and it is what the universal engine substitutes for every
 * character a host may not carry, so escaping it would bury the one row a
 * reviewer reads closely in backslashes.
 *
 * A newline would split the row itself, which no backslash can prevent, so it
 * collapses to a space instead.
