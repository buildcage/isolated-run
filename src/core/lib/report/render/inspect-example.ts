/**
 * Turns what an `audit` run observed into `allowed_url_rules` for a `restrict`
 * run, the engine's reason for existing: which URLs `npm install` reaches
 * cannot be known in advance.
 *
 * A generated rule must never permit more than was observed:
 *
 * - Hosts are enumerated, never generalised into `*.example.com`: the
 *   resolver's scope follows these patterns, so a widened host is leakable.
 * - Methods are listed exactly, never `*`.
 * - A path keeps its longest unchanging prefix; only what varied becomes
 *   `**`, and a single observed path stays exact.
 *
 * A host reached at many unrelated paths therefore collapses to `/**`, the
 * honest answer, since clustering would invent permissions nobody observed. The
 * rule still constrains the method, which no host-level rule can.
 *
 * The method, the `Host` header and the path are the step's to choose, so a
 * request whose method, host or path a rule would read as a pattern is left
 * out of the rules and listed beside them instead.
