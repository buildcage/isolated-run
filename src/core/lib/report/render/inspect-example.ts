/**
 * Turns what an `audit` run observed into `allowed_url_rules` for a `restrict`
 * run, the engine's reason for existing: which URLs `npm install` reaches
 * cannot be known in advance.
 *
 * A generated rule must never permit more than was observed:
 *
 * - **Hosts are enumerated, never generalised** into `*.example.com`: the
 *   resolver's scope follows these patterns, so a widened host is leakable.
 * - **Methods are listed exactly**, never `*`.
 * - **A path keeps its longest unchanging prefix**; only what varied becomes
 *   `**`, and a single observed path stays exact.
 *
 * A host reached at many unrelated paths therefore collapses to `/**` -- the
 * honest answer, since clustering would invent permissions nobody observed. The
 * rule still constrains the method, which no host-level rule can.
