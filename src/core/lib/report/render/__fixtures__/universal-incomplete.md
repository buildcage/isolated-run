## Outbound Traffic Report

> ⚠️ **This report is incomplete**, so the tables below are not a full record of this run.
> Either the logs don't begin where a real run does, one carries a line that cannot be
> read, or the proxy dropped lines it could not write (or could not say whether it had).
> A missing beginning was either removed or rotated out by traffic heavy enough to fill the
> 100 MB of log kept, which takes a few hundred thousand ordinary requests or a few thousand
> made as long as a request can be.
