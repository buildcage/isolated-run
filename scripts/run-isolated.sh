# run-isolated.sh — run a command in a network-isolated sandbox via runc.
#
# Creates a network namespace, wires a veth pair directly between it and the
# buildcage-proxy container's own netns (the proxy-side end is renamed to
# "sandbox0" and given the proxy's fixed gateway address -- no bridge
# involved, since this is always a 1:1 connection: one sandbox, one proxy),
# bind-mounts the host's own "/" so it can be handed to runc as a read-only
# rootfs, and execs `runc run` against an OCI bundle (config.json) that
# sandbox/oci-config.ts has already fully built -- namespaces, capabilities,
# mounts, uid/gid, and the seccomp filter are all declared there. This
# script only sets up what runc itself cannot: the network namespace's veth
# wiring into the proxy, and the rootfs bind-mount runc needs as its
# root.path (pivot_root can't target "/" itself).
#
# Must be run as root (invoked via `sudo -n` from the run action).

# Re-exec into a fresh, private mount namespace before doing anything else.
# Every concurrently running `run:` step's own scratch dir lives under the
# same /tmp, so without this, the `mount --rbind /` staging below (and `ip
# netns add`'s own bind-mount of /run/netns) would run in the one mount
# namespace shared by every step on the host -- unavoidably nesting a copy
# of each concurrently running step's rootfs tree inside every other's
# snapshot, which races their unmount/rmdir cleanup against each other.
# With this, everything this script mounts is invisible to (and
# unaffected by) every other concurrent invocation from the moment it's
# created. `--propagation private` is `unshare`'s shortcut for "unshare +
# recursively make every mount private" in one step. No `--fork`, so this
# and the subsequent exec replace the current process in place -- this
# script's PID (and /proc/self/cmdline, matched by
# integration-test-die-with-parent.sh's pgrep) stays the same across the
# re-exec.
